											<h1>About Me</h1>
											<h2>My name is Vinícius Kós</h2>
										</header>

										<!-- Content -->
											<p>I have a degree in Production Engineering and currently work as a Data Scientist at Banco BV (The fourth largest private bank in Latin America). <br/> <br/>
I am currently working on identifying opportunities for improvement in decision-making. Through mapping pains and opportunities with stakeholders, I work on designing solutions involving data, always aiming for business impact. <br/> <br/>

In addition, I also work with personal projects on Data Science, to gain experience in solving business problems and mastering data analysis tools and techniques. My goal is to design at least one data solution every two weeks for a variety of business problems: Customer clustering to help the market strategy and increase revenue, customer propensity model to improve the sales funnel, etc...</p>

											<h2>Rossmann Stores Sales Forecast</h2>
											<p>Pharmaceutical Stores Sales Forecast
<h2>Objective:</h2>
Create a sales forecasting algorithm for 1115 stores, and make it available for 24/7 access via smartphone.

<!-- <p><h2>Execution:</h2> I created a robot in the Telegram messaging application, which receives the store code, consults the algorithm via API, and returns in real time the sales forecast (invoice) for that store for the next 6 weeks.-->

<p><h2>Tools used:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Python with Machine Learning packages: sklearn and scipy.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub.</li>
<li>Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.</li>
<li>Flask, and Python and Telegram API's.</li>
<li>Regression Algorithms:Linear Regressor, Linear Regressor Regularized, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressor.</li>
<li>Cloud Computing: Deploy on Google Cloud (SDK Shell, APP Engine) </li>
</ul>


<p><h2>Business Impacts:</h2>

<ul>
<li>36% Reduction of the average error rate of sales forecasts for the entire network.</li>
<li>After the 1st half of implementation, Rossmann's half-year net income increased by 1.9%.</li>
<ul>
